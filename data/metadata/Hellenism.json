Hellenism proper is Minoan-Mykenaian in its origins, and it came to be the practiced not only by those who were born Greek by genos, but also by other peoples that came to shaped and/or influenced by the Hellenic ethos and, ultimately, adopted the Hellenic ethnos. However, this process of non-Greeks becoming Hellenes truly flourished on a global scale during what contemporary historians call the Hellenistic period, an era which began following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE. Beginning during this time, Hellenic culture and practices would be spread by Alexander\u2019s successors, the Diadokhoi, and later on eventually Rome, leading Hellenism to become the dominant religion of the ancient Mediterranean and Near East. The term Hellenism was first coined in its proper religious sense by the blessed Emperor Flavius Claudius Iulianus Augustus to refer to the general entirety of Graeco-Roman tradition as it was fundamentally derived from the Greeks, or Hellenes. Central to Hellenism is the universal desire to achieve and satisfy the human striving, or telos, for eudaimonia (Latin: Felicitas), the divinely inspired contented state of having a good indwelling spirit in which we are healthy, happy and prosperous.\nWe encourage interesting links of topics and discussion, as well as fervent debate.
